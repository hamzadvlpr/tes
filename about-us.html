          <h1>What Makes General Assembly Exceptional?</h1>
  <h2>We Offer Training in Tech, Data, Design, Business, and More</h2>

  <p>Today’s complex, global economy requires a skilled workforce that can leverage technology to fuel success. General Assembly’s robust suite of courses includes all the fundamental pillars of innovation to give individuals and <a href="#" target="blank">teams</a> several options for growth and development. We offer programs in <a href="#" target="blank">web development</a>, <a href="#" target="blank">data science</a> and <a href="#" target="blank">analysis</a>, <a href="#" target="blank">user experience design</a>, <a href="#" target="blank">digital marketing</a>, <a href="#" target="blank">product management</a>, and <a href="#" target="blank">more</a>. Students can choose from a range of formats and modalities to help them best achieve their goals, including full-time, part-time, and short-form options — on campus, and <a href="#" target="blank">online</a>.<p>

  <h2>We Have a Vast Global Network</h2>

  <p>20 <a href="#" target="blank">campuses</a>. 10,000+ <a href="#" target="blank">hiring partners</a>. 40,000+ full- and part-time course grads. And then there are the hundreds of thousands of attendees to our <a href="#" target="blank">events</a> and <a href="#" target="blank">workshops</a>. General Assembly’s global presence, <a href="#" target="blank">alumni network</a>, and hiring partners are three of our biggest assets. In addition to courses designed exclusively to meet employer needs, we foster a pipeline of industry professionals who serve as instructors, mentors, and coaches. This thriving professional network helps our <a href="#" target="blank">recent graduates find jobs</a> and make connections, setting them up for success on the job, and in life.</p>

  <h2>We Adapt to the Market</h2>

  <p>Dynamic fields like <a href="#" target="blank">data science</a> and <a href="#" target="blank">web development</a> evolve in real time, and we continuously pilot, launch, and sunset programs to respond to market demand and the evolution of tools and techniques. Our world class team of instructional designers, subject matter experts, and education product managers continuously refresh our content to ensure relevancy. By leveraging data, feedback, and insights from our proprietary <a href="#" target="blank">assessments</a>, we produce coursework that results in maximum impact on the job.</p>

  <h2>We Focus on Employer Needs and Relationships</h2>

  <p>Deep employer relationships have always been an essential part of General Assembly’s DNA. Roughly half of our part-time students are <a href="#" target="blank">funded</a> by employers who want their employees trained by our experts, and GA curricula are guided by industry needs. We’ve helped dozens of Fortune 100 companies — and hundreds of other businesses worldwide — to <a href="#" target="blank">assess</a> and <a href="#" target="blank">train</a> their talent, on-site, <a href="#" target="blank">online</a>, or at our <a href="#" target="blank">campuses</a>. We also provide hiring solutions for companies seeking a diverse <a href="#" target="blank">pipeline of candidates</a> who are job-ready, armed with in-demand skills.</p>

  <h2>We Invest in Access and Opportunity</h2>

  <p>As part of our commitment to accessible and affordable education, we're focused on developing programs and financing options to ensure that students have the means and support systems they need to learn at GA. In addition to innovative programs like <a href="#" target="blank">Adobe Digital Academy</a>, Opportunity Fund, <a href="#" target="blank">CodeBridge</a>, and <a href="#" target="blank">TechIMPACT</a> — which provide scholarships and free training programs to underserved and overlooked talent — we work with employers and financing providers to help get education costs covered. Our innovative hybrid and online immersive programs reach individuals who live outside major metro areas and give them access to the same quality education our campuses are known for.</p>
